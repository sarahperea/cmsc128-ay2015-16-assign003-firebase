In this PA, I used the GraysScale free theme from Bootstrap (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/).<br>

1.) For this app to function well, extract first the "PA003.zip" file and the extracted file must be put into your web server beside the index.html. <br>
2.) You should also change permissions for all the folders (should be "Create and Delete Files"). <br>
3.) Open the "index.html" inside the "PA003" folder with your browser and enjoy. :)
