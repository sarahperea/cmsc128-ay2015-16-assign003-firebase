In this PA, I used the GraysScale free theme from Bootstrap (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/).<br>

For this app to function well, extract first the "grayscale.zip" file and the extracted file must be put into your web server beside the index.html. <br>
You should also change permissions for all the folders (should be "Create and Delete Files"). <br>
