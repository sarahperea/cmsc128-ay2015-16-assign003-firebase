In this PA, I used the GraysScale free theme from Bootstrap (http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/).<br>
For this app to function well, the folder "grayscale" must be put into your web server directory beside the index.html. <br>
You should also change permissions for all the folders (should be "Create and Delete Files"). <br>
